<h2 id="announcements">Announcements</h2>

The first few minutes of each session are used for:
* Debriefing on a past competition
* Announce upcoming events
* Align the team on anything else

<h2 id="warmup">Warmup</h2>

The first excercise is a competitive programming challenge. PPP is a successful CTF team because of their scripting capabilities. The goal of this excercise is to increase the programming proficiency of our members.

1. Choose a programming challenge
2. Show to problem to everyone
3. The first person to post a solution explain how he did it.
4. If solution passes, close excercise.

<h2 id="workshops">Workshops</h2>

The rest of the training are workshop rotations. The goal is to practice solving CTF problems. Each rotation will cover a CTF topic (crypto, pwn, reversing, web). The whole group will be broken up into 4 groups. Each rotation will last 15-30 minutes. Individuals will volunteer or be selected to lead a rotation.

Rotations:
* Members will be broken up into 4 groups
* Duration: 15-30 minutes
* Each rotation will have a lead

Lead's responsability:
* Provide 1-5 challenges to members. Preferably, from a recent CTF.
* Help members understand and solve those challenges
